## Hi, I'm Jessica
### Who I Am
I'm a **librarian** with an interest in metadata, information architecture, taxonomy, and ontology. I'm working on my Master of Data Science from the **University of Pittsburgh**. 
### What I'm Up To
- Trying to wrap my mind around **Python**
- Poking at **SQL** because I expect it's going to be my daily driver
- Brushing up on my math skills (which, frankly, was not my focus during my liberal arts undergrad)
### What I Know
- Basic Python, including pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn
- Introductory linear regression and trend analysis, correlation analysis and variable relationships, and cross-validation
- MARC 21, Dublin Core, AACR 2, and RDA
- Collection development and management
- Instructional design
### What I Believe In
- Clean writing that conveys the writer's intention
- The importance of community
- Open-mindedness
- The Oxford comma (look, I'm allowed to be pedantic sometimes)
### What I'm Looking For:
I learn best when I have plenty of examples to refer to, so I'm mostly looking for education and inspiration
### Ask Me About:
- Information organization
- K-12 education
- Genealogy (because I've been a little old lady at heart for my whole life)
### Pronouns
she/her
### Contact Info

### Fun Fact
Like most Gen-Xers, I speak fluent movie quotes and tend to have one for almost any occasion ("I'm not even supposed to be here today" is a daily refrain).
